<h4>
    Thiruananthapuram, the jewel in the emerald necklace that Kerala is for the Indian sub-continent, must surely have Parasuramanbeen a “must see” destination for ages, long before National Geographic Traveller classified it as one. Surely long before Sage Parasurama , according to local legend, threw his divine battle axe from Kanyakumari to Gokarnam to west Kerala, God’s own land, from the Varuna the sea god; before the times of Mahabali the democratic and just ruler of this wonderful land who was sent down to the netherworld through deceit. It doesnt take any flights of fancy to imagine that this land fired the imaginations of intrepid travellers and explorers like Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Marco Polo, Fa Hien, and quite possibly, countless others from the pages of history, recorded or not.

        Famous for its esorts and ayurvedic massage centre, Kovalam is a coastal town located around 13 km from Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala. The largest beach in Kovalam is the lighthouse beach that features a 30-metre tall lighthouse. The other two adjacent beaches are Samudra beach and Hawa beach. All these three beaches are crescent-shaped shallow water and low tidal beaches.

        Earlier a fishing village, Kovalam started attracting tourists in the 1930s and shot to fame in the hippie era of 1970s. It still sees the influx of tourists from Israel and Europe.
        
        Ayurvedic treatments and massages are one of its most popular indulgences along with yoga, meditation as well as other cultural activities. Kovalam perhaps comes full circle as it is also a shopping destination given the rich spices, wooden statues and handicrafts that can make popular takeaways.

One canal of Neyyar flows to western districts of Tamil Nadu. The main river Neyyar flows through Kallikkadu, Ottasekharamangalam, Aryancode, Kezharoor, Perumkadavila, Marayamuttom, Neyyattinkara and Poovar and ends at the Arabian Sea.

        One of the 108 Divya Desams, Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple is located in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala. Embellished in gold-plated covering, the temple is opened only to Hindu followers. Dedicated to Lord Padmanabha; one of the avatars of Lord Vishnu, the Padmanabhaswamy Temple is one of the principal centres of Vaishnava worship in the dharma of Vaishnavism.

        Built as a replica of the Adikesavaperumal Temple in Thiruvattar, the Padmanabhaswamy temple is well-preserved antiquity. Although the origin of this temple still remains a mystery, devotees believe it to have existed since the first day of the Kali Yuga, which was 5000 years ago. The Padmanabhaswamy temple also has a mention in the Bhagwad Gita. The scripture states that Balarama, the older brother of Lord Krishna frequented the temple, bathed in the Padmatheertham and also made several offerings the deity here.

        Shankumugham Beach is a beach in Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala, south India. The vast stretch of white sand and the serene atmosphere, away from the crowd in the city, provide all the ingredients for relaxation and for spending an ideal evening. There is also a “Star Fish Restaurant” with eating kiosks and open-air theatre with car parking facilities. Good food can be enjoyed at the Old Coffee House, just across the beach, which is also a vantage point for enjoying the sunset. Unfortunately, the beach is not well maintained with garbage littering the entire area.
